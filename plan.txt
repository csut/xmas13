DONE - have a list of items in itinerary, sorted by date, earlier dates before later dates
DONE - when an item's date has passed, it get de-emphasized
DONE - when an item is on the same day as the current day, it gets highlighted
position in website scrolls to first item with non-elapsed date

**working in scrollToCurrent
**pass by reference is making the itin item generator go insane, maybe do a new object creator?

angular loads at bottom of body

itinerary items should be stored in javascript objects for easier javascript Date maniuplation in format:
	{startTime: Date(), description: 'description'}
ng-repeat unrolls the contents of $scope.itinerary
each item listed in format:
	<itin-item start-time="{{startTime}}">{{description}}</itin-item>
